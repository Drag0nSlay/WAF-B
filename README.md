# WAF-B 
## Web Application Firewall Bypass Tool

This project provides a set of tools to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs) and other security measures. The tools are designed to help penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security researchers to assess the security of web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Decoding:
  - Decodes encoded text formats like Base64 or URL encoding.
  - Can be used to decode text found in web application responses.

- Exploitation:
  - Identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in web applications.
  - Can be used to test the security of web applications against common vulnerabilities.

- Anomalous Traffic:
  - Analyzes network traffic to detect anomalous patterns.
  - Can be used to identify potential security threats or attacks.

- Tunneling:
  - Establishes tunnels for remote access using SSH or VPN.
  - Can be used to gain access to restricted areas of web applications.

- HPP:
  - Manipulates HTTP parameters to bypass HPP filters.
  - Can be used to bypass client-side input validation.
